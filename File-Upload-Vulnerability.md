# File Upload Vulnerability 

In this attack an file is upload with the required filters with respect to the extension like jpg and png then that file is intercepted by the use of burp suite software to rename that file back to the orginal extension. 

example - shell.php.jpg ---> (filters jpg, png) ---> intercept ---> rename shell.php
